# MacPrinterScript

A **very simple** script written to streamline the installation of printers on Mac computers. 

After typing in seven 10-digit IP addresses way too many times as an IT consultant, I decided to find a faster way, thus MacPrinterScript was born. Now, all the printers are configured in one double-click of this AppleScript application.

It is currently configured to use a Generic Postscript driver and allow duplex (double-sided) printing, however is easily adaptable to fit the needs of any organization. 

*The IP addresses have been hidden on the GitHub version for obvious reasons.*
