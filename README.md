# MacPrinterScript

When I first started my IT job, only students with Windows could use our printers, but I quickly found a way to connect from Macs. 

Unfortunately this involved multiple drop-down menus and typing a 10-digit IP address for each of the 7 printers. 
One day after typing these IP addresses too many times to count, I decided to automate the process.

I learned a bit of AppleScript and now we simply double click the application icon and have all 7 printers configured at once. 

Feel free to adapt this script to fit your organization's needs, it's currently configured as Generic PostScript Duplex (double-sided capable) printers.

*The IP addresses have been hidden on the GitHub version for obvious reasons.*
